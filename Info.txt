ENVIRONMENT:
    OS: macOS Catalina 10.15.4

    Conan version: 1.26.0 (also happens in older versions)

    For the profile, I used my default (
        [settings]
        os=Macos
        os_build=Macos
        arch=x86_64
        arch_build=x86_64
        compiler=apple-clang
        compiler.version=10.0
        compiler.libcxx=libc++
        build_type=Release
        [options]
        [build_requires]
        [env]
    ), but I don't think the profile matters.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE THE BUG:

- Add the following Conan remote, if you don't clready have it:
    conan-center: https://conan.bintray.com [Verify SSL: True]

- package-3 depends on package-2, which depends on package-1, so do the following:
    From the folder 'package-1', run:
        conan create . 1.0@error/test --profile=<PROFILE> --build=outdated

    From the folder 'package-2', run:
        conan create . 1.0@error/test --profile=<PROFILE> --build=outdated

    From the folder 'package-3', run:
        conan create . 1.0@error/test --profile=<PROFILE> --build=outdated -o package-3:shared=True

    (up until this point, all should have gone well)

    Now try to build package-3 again, this time explicitly asking to rebuild libcurl:
        conan create . 1.0@error/test --profile=<PROFILE> --build=libcurl -o package-3:shared=True

    This last step should fail with a following error:
            assert node.package_id != PACKAGE_ID_UNKNOWN
            AssertionError

            ERROR: <EMPTY>

**NOTE** Call the provided script "test.sh" to call all 4 of the above commands.

- However, if you remove the last two lines (
        def package_id(self):
        self.info.shared_library_package_id()
  ) from conanfile.py of package-3, this error does not happen and the package is created properly.
